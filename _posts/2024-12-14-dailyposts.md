Day 5 (December 14th)
---

  On December 14th, the stress of not being able to finish on time (warranted in my opinion) wore off significantly once I was in the swing of things and saw how much I got done. At this point, I realized it would be a good idea to create a my **game_over** function for my **button_click** function to call, which is really its only purpose. This is when I had a little burst of excitement. The only thing **game_over** has to do is **return check_winner**. But then... oh wait, as I'm writing this I realize there's actually no point for a **game_over** function if my **if statements** give me **bool** values in the end. I think I was just so set on my original idea-which I will give myself credit, made some sort of sense in the vague beginning after refining and tweaking but I disregarded logic until the last second. Well, I guess I'm down to five functions.
  
  This means that I slightly overestimated the work I would be doing today, but within the upcoming days, I will figure out a way to reset the whole grid after a draw or winner, activated by a reset button under the grid.
