title: Day 1 (December 10th)

  Hello! Apologies for the lateness but I was busy and felt that it would be easier to write this description after a few days of marination. Today I began my journey to create a Graphical User Interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I decided to dive right in, and took Lux's advice to use the tkinter library. Tkinter is one of the standard libraries in Python, like plotly, math, and random. 

  Now, for just one day, I learned a lot more than I was expecting. The first thing I learned was that I could not use the tkinter library in Google Colab, because it does not support GUI stuff. So then I downloaded Homebrew from my Terminal application, and I already had Python on my computer so that was good. Next, I decided it would be a good idea to install and launch Jupyter Notebook, because I could edit it from my web browser kind of like Colab, but it would support tkinter. 
  
  Next I familiarized myself with the Juypter and began learning about the basics of tkinter. I honestly love how straightforward the library is, the syntax just feels so logical. To start off anything with tkinter, you have to ***import tkinter as tk***. To test if everything is up and running, you write ***tk._test***, cuasing a Python window to pop up confirming that everything is working. A tedious thing with the Jupyter Notebook-Python window set up is when you run the code, it won't change anything on the window until you close out of it and run the code on Juypter again.  
  
  To initialize a new window for the GUI, you say ***root = tk.Tk()***. Something I found really interesting as was that if you run that, alone, nothing new will pop up. This is becuase the application is being opened and closes too quickly to notice. A way to solve that issue is to say ***root.mainloop()***, and this basically keeps the window open for you to see. What we have right now is the template/scaffolding/canvas for the whole GUI. All the code will be sandwiched between ***import tkinter as tk*** and ***root.mainloop()*** 
  To name the window you do
