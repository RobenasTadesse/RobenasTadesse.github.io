title: Day 1 (December 10th)

  Hello! Apologies for the lateness but I was busy and felt that it would be easier to write this description after a few days of marination. Today I began my journey to create a Graphical User Interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I decided to dive right in, and took Lux's advice to use the tkinter library. Tkinter is one of the standard libraries in Python, like plotly, math, and random. 

  Now, for just one day, I learned a lot more than I was expecting. The first thing I learned was that I could not use the tkinter library in Google Colab, because it does not support GUI stuff. So then I downloaded Homebrew from my Terminal application, and I already had Python on my computer so that was good. Next, I decided it would be a good idea to install and launch Jupyter Notebook, because I could edit it from my web browser kind of like Colab, but it would support tkinter. 
  Next I familiarized myself with the Juypter and began learning about the basics of tkinter. I honestly love how straightforward the library is, the syntax just feels so logical. To start off anything with tkinter, you have to ***import tkinter as tk***
