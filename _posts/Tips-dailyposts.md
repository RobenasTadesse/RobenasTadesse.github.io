# Day 9 (December 18th)
  The thing I found most important about programming fundamentals is keeping a positive, engaged, open mind. If you just start hating everything because you're not good at programming, you'll never get better. So if you fake it till you make it you'll do fine. Also don't worry if someone seems more "skilled" than you. Many things in life are illusions, and your perception of the people around you are one of them, especially when it comes it academic achievements. Just don't let it define you!

  My perceptions haven't really changed that much over the semester, I just feel like I learned some very good lessons on perseverance and how powerful a positive mindset can impact growth. I definitely became a better person for myself and others because now I sympathize with those who are struggling with other topics that I deem easy, and I'm a better person to myself because I've really diminished my knack for comparing myself to others. 

### A Letter to Incoming Semester 2 Students

  Specifically for those of you who have never or barely coded using Python, this class WILL be hard, expect it and 
prepare with the necessary measures. And as I'm writing this I know it won't do much because I was basically told 
the same thing but made the same mistakes you guys are about to do: letting your questions go unanswered, being afraid 
to speak up in class, not asking for help, avoiding office hours, and putting off homework. For a lot of you, this is unlike 
any class you've ever taken, and any advice I could give would sound clich√© and over-iterated. So please prove me wrong.

  But at the same time, don't be too hard on yourself if you think you aren't grasping things as quickly as other people, there are so many things that are happening with other people that it's statistically ridiculous for you to be making rash assumptions. And most importantly, try your best not to get frustrated or exasperated when things aren't going perfectly (I know it's really hard). But just think of how accomplished and proud you'll feel at the end of the year knowing you've given it your all. The feeling will be immensely rewarding. Have an amazing second semester, I'm rooting for you!
