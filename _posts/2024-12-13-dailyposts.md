Day 4 (December 13th)
---

  I didn't do much on December day because I've been spending all the time I take for homework working on my tic-tac-toe GUI, and that's my fault, I should have been more organized and efficient with my time. But I'll use this day to give advice for incoming Programming Fundamentals semester 2 students:

  Specifically for those of you who have never or barely coded using Python, this class WILL be hard, expect it and prepare with the necessary measures. And as I'm writing this I know it won't do much because I was basically told the same thing but made the same mistakes you guys are about to do: letting your questions go unanswered, being afraid to speak up in class, not asking for help, avoiding office hours, and putting off homework. For a lot of you this is unlike any class you've ever taken, and any advice I could give would sound cliché and over-iterated. So prove me wrong and have an amazing second semester, I'm rooting for you!
