Specifically for those of you who have never or barely coded using Python, this class WILL be hard, expect it and 
prepare with the necessary measures. And as I'm writing this I know it won't do much because I was basically told 
the same thing but made the same mistakes you guys are about to do: letting your questions go unanswered, being afraid 
to speak up in class, not asking for help, avoiding office hours, and putting off homework. For a lot of you this is unlike 
any class you've ever taken, and any advice I could give would sound clich√© and over-iterated. So prove me wrong and have an amazing second semester, I'm rooting for you!
