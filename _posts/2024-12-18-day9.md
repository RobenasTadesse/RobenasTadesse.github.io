# December 18th

  I finished creating my Google Slides and speaker notes only to realize while I was practicing that my presentation would be ten minutes long instead of five. I just feel so obliged to mention everything when realistically, that's not achievable in five minutes. After I reviewed the Slack message and the guidelines on Canvas I really cut down (painfully) on the unnecessary, redundant, and boring aspects of my presentation. The third time I practiced, I got my time down to 5 minutes on the dot. Right now I feel really prepared and relaxed, almost excited, but I always get really nervous at the last second, even if I'm apparently good at masking it. 

  I am honestly impressed by how quickly I whipped up a presentation, it only took me five hours to feel comfortable, which is pretty quick for me. Although getting started on the slideshow was difficult because I asked myself, "What do I say, and will it sound stupid?" I should probably stop being so doubtful of my abilities though, it won't help me grow as a person.

  I am so proud of where I got this semester and am ready to go out with a bang with this presentation. In twelve hours I will be completely done with Computer Fundamentals, and although I am elated to have accomplished something I would have never thought about years ago, I will have bittersweet memories over break. I guess my next steps are to continue to practice my presentation, present well, and finish off the semester.
