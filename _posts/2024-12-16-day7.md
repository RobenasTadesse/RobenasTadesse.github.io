# December 16th

  I really didn't do much today because I've been spending a lot of time studying for other classes' exams. I've planned my general structure for my presentation: saying what I did and why, showing how my game is playable, explaining what my code does line by line, talking about my challenges and what I did to get around them, and I'll finish off with how I recommend other people to go about using the `tkinter` library. 
  
  On a different note, I would like to mention that I am extremely proud of myself for being able to make this game with nothing but information from the internet. How I imagined this project was panicky and crazy, but I think since I really pushed hard early on, everything's going smoothly now.

  Because we are presenting in just three days (oh my goodness) I plan to finish my notes and practice several times with a live audience (family and friends), making sure I will feel comfortable when I am talking. Also, I will of course need to make sure I hit five minutes, nothing more, nothing less, so I will use a hand stopwatch. I am so excited to complete Computer Programming!
